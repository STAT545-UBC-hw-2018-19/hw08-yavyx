####Author: Javier Castillo-Arnemann

This is a repository containing the 3rd assignment of the **STAT 547** course. The course main page can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom). The instructions for this assignment can be accesed [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw08/hw08.html).

For this assignment, I added the following features to the basic BCL app:

- Edited the histogram so it has a nicer presentation
- Used the [`DT` (DataTables)](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package to make the table interactive.
- Added a download button.
- Added a sort by price check box.
- Changed the app's theme with [Shiny Themes](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/) package.

The app can be found [here](https://yavyx.shinyapps.io/bcl_app/).

The app was derived from [Dean Attali's Shiny tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code). The data anlyzed in the app can be found [here]().
